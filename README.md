5. Run the development server:
bash
npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Database Schema

### Schools Table

  image TEXT,
  email_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_by VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


### Users Table

sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


### OTP Table
For OTP verification:
sql
CREATE TABLE otp_verification (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  otp VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow:
1. User enters email ‚Üí OTP sent via email
2. User enters OTP ‚Üí JWT token generated
3. Token stored in secure HTTP-only cookie
4. Middleware validates token for protected routes
5. Session expires after 1 hour

### Security Measures:
- JWT tokens with expiration
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- Route protection middleware
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
